            <article>
               Before starting this blog website, i was thinking,
               "should i start blogging in Italian or continue 
               to improve my English?". A little bit funny I know. 
               I was born in <em><strong>Tema (Ghana)</strong></em>, oh sorry my name is <strong>Latiff Mohammed</strong>. At a young age, I was always at
               the internet point
               (we used to call it internet caf√®) and I spent 
               most of the afternoons after school with a friend
               of mine <strong>[LESLIE].</strong> Not going into so many details,
               I realized to be in love with technology and so I
               asked my father to get me a computer. Fortunately
               at school <strong>[CREATOR SCHOOLS] </strong> we had computer science
               so I was always improving my typing skills everytime
               we had a class.

               At the age of 14, I had to move to
               Italy and be with my family. Had to learn the
               language, integrate and I did my best. After my
               studies, I didn't really know what to do in life so
               I decided to work and try to find out what I'm 
               really passionate about. While working I knew in mind
               that im not going to work for my entire life so I 
               started thinking about my childhood and what I loved 
               doing the most. I remembered being behind my computer 
               was something i really loved and in 2019 I decided
               to take a one year <strong>[WEB DESIGN]</strong> course in Padova.
               Unfortunately I couldn't find a job as a web designer
               so i came to my ordinary 9-5 works.
               In 2022 after I
               lost my full-time job in Amazon, I still knew I 
               needed more for my life so I took the [SELF-TAUGHT]
               route to become a Web Developer. This was the best
               decision I ever made in my life. Right now I'm 
               studying the Frontend <strong>[HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT].</strong>

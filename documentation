WHY I CHOSE TO STUDY & LEARN HOW TO CODE

-first article-

Before starting this blog website, i was thinking,
"should i start blogging in Italian or continue 
to improve my English?". A little bit funny I know
[LOL]. 
I was born in Tema (Ghana), oh sorry my name is
Latiff Mohammed. At a young age, I was always at
the internet point
(we used to call it internet caf√®) and I spent 
most of the afternoons after school with a friend
of mine [CANTONA]. Not going into so many details,
I realized to be in love with technology and so I
asked my father to get me one. Fortunately
at school [CREATOR SCHOOLS] we had computer science
so I was always improving my typing skills everytim
we had a class.

At the age of 14, I had to move to
Italy and be with my family. Had to learn the
language, integrate and I did my best. After my
studies, I didn't really know what to do in life so
I decided to work and try to find out what I'm 
really passionate about. While working I knew in mind
that im not going to work for my entire life so I 
started thinking about my childhood and what I loved 
doing the most. I remembered being behind my computer 
was something i really loved and in 2019 I decided
to take a one year WEB DESIGN course in Padova.
Unfortunately I couldn't find a job as a web designer
so i came to my ordinary 9-5 works. In 2022 after I
lost my full-time job in Amazon, I still knew I 
needed more for my life so I took the [SELF-TAUGHT]
route to become a Web Developer. This was the best
decision I ever made in my life. Right now I'm 
studying the Frontend [HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT].
